Cable car operations at the Table Mountain Aerial Cableway Company will be suspended from July 25 to allow  safety maintenance work on its  infrastructure. The shutdown is scheduled until August 28. “The process this year is extensive and complex, which will require a five-week  complete shutdown as the work scheduled for this year cannot be carried out  between normal operations,” said MD Wahida Parker. Emile Streicher, the company's executive manager of technical, said: “The focus for this year will be on the track-ropes which carry  most of the weight of the cable cars, along with the brackets from which the cabins are suspended and the hydraulic braking system  at the lower station.” TimesLIVE
