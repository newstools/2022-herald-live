Seven men have been sentenced to  10 years' imprisonment each after pleading guilty to tampering with, damaging and destroying essential Transnet railway infrastructure. Mlamuli Mntungwana, 38, Sipho Mkhwanazi, 52, Felamandla Mpanza, 45, Nhlakanipho Mkhwanazi, 33, Thembinkosi Ngema, 41, Sabelo Mathola, 32, and Njabulo Ncube, 32, were sentenced in the Camperdown regional court in KwaZulu-Natal. National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) spokesperson Natasha Kara said the men cut up and stole railway  tracks  in the Richmond area in January. “They were arrested the next day while on their way to the scrapyard with the railway lines loaded in bakkies. The estimated value of the metal is R750,000. In aggravation of sentence, the state told the court  the offence was serious and all too prevalent, thus negatively affecting our ailing economy.” The men were sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment each, three of which were suspended with conditions. They will serve an effective seven years in prison.
