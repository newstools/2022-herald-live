The eThekwini municipality will not  have stage 4 load-shedding on Friday. Municipal spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela told TimesLIVE  Eskom's decision to ramp up rotational power cuts  due to protests  and to safeguard emergency reserves  would not immediately affect Durban residents. “eThekwini  remains exempt. There  are still a lot of things we have to sort out  after the floods before we can load-shed.” A meeting with the city's head of electricity was scheduled for Friday. “We will communicate after the meeting, but for now there is no load-shedding today [Friday] or for the weekend in eThekwini.” TimesLIVE
