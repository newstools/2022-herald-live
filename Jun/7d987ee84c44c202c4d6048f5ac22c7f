Community members joined security staff and police to thwart possible looting  at a mall near Pietermaritzburg on Thursday evening. Hammarsdale councillor Lungisani  Sikhakhane told TimesLIVE on Friday  Junction Mall was under threat of looting when large crowds of people showed up  at about 9.30pm. The incident comes  amid threats of a national shutdown on Friday which prompted police and other authorities to deploy law enforcement officers in anticipation of  protest action, violence or looting. “We heard rumours circulating in the area about the looting that will take place. Our community members stood up and said we will not allow this to happen again. If you can remember we had a very hard time in July last year. You couldn’t get bread — some people paid R25.” The community decided  they didn't want a repeat of the hardships they endured, with many saying  they were still trying to recover. Clusters of community members were patrolling the area and standing guard outside the  mall, warming themselves in front of fires on Friday. TimesLIVE
