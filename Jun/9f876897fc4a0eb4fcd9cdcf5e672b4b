A man arrested in connection with the alleged kidnapping of Shireen Essop has appeared in the Cape Town magistrate's court after he was found in possession of a cellphone believed to belong to Essop. Police tracked the cellphone  via co-ordinates. Police spokesperson Brig Novela Potelwa  said: “As part of  investigations into the disappearance of 34-year-old Shireen Essop and her subsequent return, organised crime detectives armed with intelligence arrested a 28-year-old suspect on a charge of possession of stolen property believed to be that of  Essop.” The  suspect, a Malawian, had no prior convictions and was  in  SA as an asylum seeker, though his permit expired last year and it had not been renewed. Magistrate Ronel Oliver said the state did not have sufficient information to grant bail and requested  the necessary information be ready at  his next appearance. Essop was reported missing on  May 23 after she was last seen driving home from work on Weltevreden Road near Browns Farm, Philippi. She was missing for almost a month until she  turned up on  June 11 at the Klipfontein mission station in the early hours of the morning. Rumours circulated on social media  alleging she was on a drug binge and not kidnapped. Essop  has yet to  comment. However, her brother-in-law has denied  the kidnapping was a fabrication. The accused will appear in court again on July 1. “As investigations into the case continue, the arrest of more suspects cannot be ruled out,” Potelwa added. TimesLIVE
