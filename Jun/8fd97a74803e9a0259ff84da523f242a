A  Soweto pensioner, who marched on Tuesday with fellow residents to hand over a memorandum of grievances to  Johannesburg mayor Mpho Phalatse, says he has at times gone without electricity for a year. Robert Nene, 69, who lives in Naledi, said most residents in the area struggled to pay for electricity because they are not working. “They want a lot of money and that’s why people cannot afford to pay.” Nene was among hundreds of  Soweto residents who marched  to the mayor’s office to voice their displeasure  about the lack of service delivery in the township. On Monday residents blockaded  roads in the area, bringing the city’s Rea Vaya bus services to a halt. Nene described daily life without electricity as a struggle. “It is very bad. Everything is controlled by electricity. The kids, who are studying, cannot do anything without electricity. If you come to these big guys, the big shots  will tell you  you must pay R6,500. Where are you going to get that money?” Nene said as a pensioner he does not know how he would be able to afford what was required of him. “I have kids and grandchildren at the house. They rely on my grant money. It is food, then  electricity, water and everything else. Do you think you can make it  on R1,900?” Asked if attending the march would help solve residents’ problems, he said he did not think  their problems could be addressed. “The  people are fighting on top there. That’s why they  do not know what they must do. We will  wait for them and see.” TimesLIVE
