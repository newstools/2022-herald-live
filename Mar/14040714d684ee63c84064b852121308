The N3 near Harrismith in the Free State was closed on Thursday morning after a serious crash between two trucks. The N3 Toll Concession said the closure resulted in a build-up of traffic while emergency services worked on the scene. “Traffic is now being accommodated using contraflow to pass the scene. “Road users should, however, continue to expect slow-moving traffic and delays while the recovery and cleanup operations continue and the extensive backlog of traffic is being cleared.” Real-time route and traffic updates can be obtained by contacting the N3 helpline on 0800-63-43-57 or by following @N3Route on Twitter.
