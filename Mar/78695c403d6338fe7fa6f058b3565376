South Africans are between 108%  and 130% more likely to submit power surge insurance claims after  experiencing a spike in voltage after load-shedding. This is according to Discovery Insure, which on Wednesday warned that the risk of power surge damage increased threefold during stage  4 load-shedding. Discovery Insure’s Kgodiso Mokonyane said recent claims data revealed  clients “are between 108% and 130% more likely to submit a power surge insurance claim after experiencing a spike in voltage after a load-shedding event”. These claims are directly impacting household costs, with many clients having to claim for the replacement of expensive appliances  damaged during load-shedding. South Africans have experienced load-shedding for 15 years, with scheduled power cuts first implemented in 2007 as part of a plan to support Eskom in managing power supply issues. “A major surge can cause more permanent damage instantly, but smaller disruptions typically tend to shorten the ‘lifespan’ of a  device or appliance over a longer period.” How to protect your appliances against damage: TimesLIVE
