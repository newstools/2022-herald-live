Former EFF student  organisation member Bonginkosi Khanyile has likened red berets leader Julius Malema to apartheid-era Bantustan leader Kaiser Matanzima. Khanyile said Malema's sidelining of Operation Dudula leader Nhlanhla "Lux" Dlamini was similar to when Matanzima signed apartheid-era legislation  which to some extent made tribal leaders proxies  of the  government. Leaders who refused to sign  were  removed from their positions, he said. The EFF accompanied Soweto resident Victor Ramerafe to open an assault and theft  case against  Dlamini at the Dobsonville police station on Wednesday. Ramerafe's  home was allegedly ransacked by Operation Dudula members on Sunday while they were “searching for drugs” after a tip-off from the community. Khanyile took to  social media  to condemn Malema for not showing leadership, as a senior to  Dlamini, and instead taking a path that could lead to black-on-black violence. “Instead of attacking Nhlanhla Lux and shouting at him  at every opportunity he gets at his rallies, he is supposed to call the young man over [for] a political discussion and educate him where he thinks he might be misled. “Julius should  start acting his age. His childishness will lead to a similar situation  as that of the IFP/ANC violence of the early 1990s.” Khanyile had reached out to Dlamini for a meeting to discuss Operation Dudula and share his disagreements where necessary. Khanyile announced in February that he was looking for a new political home after being expelled from the EFF. He was accused of instigating unrest during the July 2021 riots. TimesLIVE
