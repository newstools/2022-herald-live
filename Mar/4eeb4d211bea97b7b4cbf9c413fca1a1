The SA Social Security Agency (Sassa) has responded to frustrated R350 social relief of distress (SRD) grant applicants whose requests  for a review have not yet been approved. . This week, grant applicants flooded Sassa’s social media pages to complain about not getting feedback on their review  request after their initial application was  cancelled without  explanation. Applicants have the right to request a review  within 30 days of receiving a reason for their application being declined. Responding to the complaints, Sassa said people  who applied for a review  should be patient. “We are busy with it. We will be issuing communication soon. We apologise  for the delay,” said Sassa. The agency said people  who feel aggrieved at  their application outcome should  call Sassa on 0800 60 10 11 or lodge a complaint on the SRD website. “Please note that Sassa has a high call volume due to the special Covid-19 SRD social grant. Not all calls will be attended to immediately. Please be patient when calling. Alternatively, you may send us a DM [direct message on social media] for any social grant-related query.” Sassa added that bank verification does not have a set time frame. “The applicant's details go to the Treasury [and] to the  bank chosen by the applicant. When it is verified it  goes back to the Treasury and is then  handed over to Sassa for payment.”
