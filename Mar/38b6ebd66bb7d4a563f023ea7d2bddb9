Sudanese protesters decried sliding economic conditions as they marched in cities across the country and the capital Khartoum on Monday in continued demonstrations against military rule. Since military rulers took over the government in October of last year, the Sudanese pound has lost about a third of its value, mostly over the last month. Prices for bread and petrol have risen sharply in recent weeks. The coup resulted in the already-struggling country being cut off from foreign aid, but military leaders have pushed forward with economic reforms, including last week ending government management of the exchange rate. Early on Monday, student demonstrations erupted in the cities of Atbara, Nyala and Damazin, in protest of rising prices, resistance committees said. Social media users recalled that the actions were reminiscent of initial student protests against the regime of Omar al-Bashir in December 2018 which were sparked by bread prices. Those protests eventually resulted in the 2019 toppling of Bashir and his replacement with a civilian-military power-sharing agreement until the coup. Teachers also continued a strike on Monday, as did railway workers in Atbara, protesting low salaries. Monday's demonstrations in Khartoum called attention to the continued detention of several politicians and citizens. Lawyers say the protesters who are accused of killing a police officer may have been tortured. Military authorities say the detentions were made according to normal criminal procedures. Protesters faced teargas and stun grenades but were able to come within 200 meters of the presidential palace. Reuters
