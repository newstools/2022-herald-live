Eskom on Wednesday said severe weather predicted for some parts of the Eastern Cape may put its network at risk and could affect the electricity supply for customers. Eskom said it  was preparing for severe thunderstorms with damaging winds in parts of Buffalo City Metro, Great Kei, Amahlathi, Raymond Mhlaba, Ngqushwa, Mbhashe and King Sabata Dalindyebo local municipalities on Thursday. It said inclement weather  could affect the electricity supply for customers, potentially leaving some  without electricity for long periods. Eskom urged customers to be patient and follow the channels made available to log faults. “We urge customers to  treat all electricity appliances as live during this time.” TimesLIVE
