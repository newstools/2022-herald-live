The highest Covid-19 positivity rate is  among children aged between 10 and 14 years. This is according to health minister Joe Phaahla, who warned  the age group’s positivity rate was  21%. Phaahla said this was very concerning and  scientists initially believed it was related to the reopening of schools. He said the surge in Covid-19  infections was not decreasing. “The percentage testing positive in the past week was highest in Mpumalanga at 14%, followed by Western Cape at 12,6% and North West at 10,5%.  All other provinces had a below 10% positivity rate. The  positive percentage was higher in the 10-14 year age group at 21%,” said Phaahla. He said people in the 18-34 year group were the biggest drawback with 4% coverage and 29,3% fully vaccinated. “We hope  the initiative by young people to drive the vaccination campaign of their peers  launched two weeks ago will bear fruit. Total doses administered to the 12-17 years cohort stands at just over 1,65-million.” Phaahla said women were still leading in terms of vaccination numbers with 56,5% coverage and 43,5% coverage for men. “Out of 19,08-million adults vaccinated, 47,95%  received at least one jab, “We should be able to pass  48% coverage over the next few days, which is still a far cry from the 70% coverage required for population immunity. The 60+ cohort remain our best performers at 68%, while the 50-59 age group stand at 64% and over-50s at overall 60% full vaccination.”
