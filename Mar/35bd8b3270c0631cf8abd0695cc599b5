SABC executives rubber-stamped an unlawful decision to pay “music legends” a R50,000 windfall without any business case  before them. This is the argument that the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) and the SABC is pushing in the Special Tribunal as it tries to set aside the controversial decision and recover R2.5m  paid to music legends in 2016. Former SABC COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng and nine other former executives, including former Group CEO James Aguma, have been hauled before the Special Tribunal by the SIU and SABC in a bid to declare their decision to make “gratuity payments” to 180 “music legends” unlawful and set aside. Motsoeneng and the nine executives decided that 183 musicians  would be paid for the role they played during apartheid. Only 53 of them were paid R50,000 each in 2016. Jabu Motsepe SC, for the SIU and the SABC — joint applicants in the matter — argued  there was no  budget for the expenditure and  there was no business case presented for the payments. Motsepe  said the payments were unlawful and there was no policy to   authorise them. “The decision was made without a policy, the operations committee sat there and approved the decision when it did not even have a business case in front of it and the SIU will show that in terms of the delegation of authority framework they ought to have had a business case before deciding on  this matter.” The operations committee should have sought a motivation before  approving the decision, which  committed the SABC to R10m  as 180 “legends” were approved to receive the “gratuity payments”. Motsepe said  members of the committee who did not dissent have to be held personally liable for the decision. The matter continues. SowetanLIVE
