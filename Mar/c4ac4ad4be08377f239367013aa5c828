Everything was rosy in Sydney Mthembu's roadside garden until the SA National Roads Agency (Sanral) nipped his only source of income in the bud. Pictures of Mthembu crying next to what was his garden at the Salt Rock interchange northbound  off-ramp on the N2, shortly after Sanral  dug it up, were posted on social media. The 32-year-old lost a  leg when he was hit by a truck at the age of 12. He started  the garden two years ago and has been selling   vegetables and plants at a traffic light near a  shopping centre on the KwaZulu-Natal north coast. Mthembu was aware that while he had the support of  most locals, several had complained to authorities. Sanral  project manager in the eastern region Trevor Zumani said they had asked Mthembu several times to remove the garden. “In terms of  the Sanral  Act, particularly as a road safety concern, the road reserve is to be kept clear at all times for the benefit of  motorists and for future road needs. As such, no trading, planting of vegetables or other illegal occupation or trading within the road reserve is permitted. “Sanral has had numerous engagements with the gentleman responsible for the garden and requested him to remove his vegetables as he placed not only himself but other road users at risk,” he said. Ward 22 councillor Privi Makhan confirmed on Thursday that the garden was removed. “The removal of the informal garden was undertaken last week after  numerous requests by Sanral for the individual to desist from using  the road reserve for a  purpose it is not intended for. It  remains the prerogative of Sanral  to ensure that their road reserves are used  in compliance with the National Road Traffic Act.” Makhan said  people within the community were exploring initiatives to integrate and equip young people  such as  Mthembu. But Mthembu is not giving up his spot on the roadside so easily. For now, he is  selling chips and sweets on the road in the same vicinity. TimesLIVE
