Public works and infrastructure minister Patricia de Lille has slammed claims she was held hostage in a shopping mall by small, micro and medium enterprises  protesters  in Gqeberha. This week, protesters forcefully opened Ster-Kinekor gates at Baywest Mall to disrupt a meeting  attended by De Lille and public works deputy minister Noxolo Kiviet and Nelson Mandela Bay mayor Eugene Johnson. Speaking to SABC News, De Lille said claims of her being held hostage by protesters were not true. The meeting was held in a boardroom next to the toilets where SMMEs were protesting. “It’s  not true. The mayor and I diffused the situation by speaking to the shopping centre management to give us room to sit down and meet  the aggrieved small business [owners].” “There was no hostage [situation], nothing. Only a demand to ask the police to release their colleagues. So, to correct all this, I am safe, I’m home in Pretoria.” On Wednesday, De Lille and minister in the presidency Mondli Gungubele conducted an oversight visit to the N2 Nodal Development project in  Nelson Mandela Bay . The development is  part of the Infrastructure Investment Plan approved by cabinet in May 2020. “The project is part of 50 strategic integrated projects and 12 special projects totalling R340bn singled out in 2020. It is made up of 12,100 new housing opportunities with more than  500,000m² of retail, commercial, and office space and  industrial, community and social facilities,” said the presidency. More than R18bn will be spent during the implementation phase  and about  86,956 jobs will be created during the construction phase. “It is estimated that 910 new formal small, medium and micro enterprises will  benefit from the project. “The investment is expected to generate about  R51.1bn  for the provincial economy.”
