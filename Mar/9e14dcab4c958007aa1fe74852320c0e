Many have praised lobby group AfriForum’s court action against the department of international relations & cooperation (Dirco), which had set aside R50m to donate to the Cuban government  for  food security in that country. On Tuesday the Pretoria high court  granted AfriForum an urgent interdict preventing Dirco from making the donation and ordered it to pay the costs of the application. The group welcomed the interdict, saying it will  submit a review application at a later date to overturn  government’s decision to make the donation. Reiner Duvenage, campaign officer for strategy and content at AfriForum, said the donation was unlawful and shameful. “We are pleased we managed to stop this unlawful and shameful donation in its tracks. We are optimistic our review application will succeed in making a final end to the matter. AfriForum pledges to continue its fight against outrageous and wasteful expenditure which is squandering taxpayers’ money.” Last month deputy Dirco minister Alvin Botes told a parliamentary portfolio committee  the donation would help Cuba’s food insecurity amid US sanctions. Dirco came under fire for the donation and was met with calls to reverse it by a coalition of community-based  NGOs and feeding schemes who said  government should use the R50m to tackle hunger in SA. “The coalition believes  an end to hunger is possible, but only through the collaboration of government and non-government organisations uniting efforts, expertise and resources. “The coalition believes the donation of R50m to a foreign country on the basis of international relations is a gross misallocation of funds, at best,” said the coalition.
