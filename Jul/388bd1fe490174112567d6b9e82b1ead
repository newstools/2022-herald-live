As thousands of children return to school from Tuesday, parents and caregivers once again face the challenge of providing nutritious, affordable and quick-to-prepare school lunch boxes. While a hastily made sandwich and cold drink were once acceptable, the rules of the game have changed. Long school hours and lengthy commutes require more substantial meals, while the spiralling cost of living has made convenience shopping expensive. Food allergies and intolerances add another level of complexity. Factor in load-shedding, with schedules that change rapidly, and you have all the ingredients for a family argument, late arrival at school, and possibly wasted food. To add to the challenge, in some school circles the standard of snacks has been elevated. Some parents opt to provide expensive, pre-packaged meals, create Instagram-worthy sandwiches, and carve fruit and vegetables into appealing mini-sculptures. “Life is stressful enough for parents and children without making school lunches an area of competitiveness,” Shafeeka Anthony, marketing manager of personal finance portal JustMoney.co.za, said. Anthony is also a busy mother of two children. “Have some perspective and focus on health, quality and taste,” she said. “This will save you time and money, and leave you with more cash to invest in your children’s long-term future.” JustMoney provided 10 lunch box tips to relieve stress on a busy school day: Anthony said: “Finally, remember to have fun when preparing for another busy school term. “Your children grow up so fast, and time with them is precious. “Pop the occasional sweet treat in the lunch box, include a loving note, tuck in a birthday surprise, or add a sticker that is bound to make them smile. “There are so many pressures on children already, so don’t make school lunches the cause of family friction.” HeraldLIVE
