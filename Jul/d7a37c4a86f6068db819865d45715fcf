Two Tshwane metro police  officials were arrested on Monday evening at Garsfontein police station in Pretoria East for alleged harassment and extortion. Their arrest  came after a case of harassment and extortion was opened by a  woman  who  alleged the two officials had followed her to her house in the Erasmuskloof area  and forced her to accompany them to an ATM to withdraw R3,000. She said the ATM was out of order and they  decided to  use a money transfer service instead. MMC for community safety  Grandi Theunissen said the woman reported  she felt unsafe during the incident and was intimidated to a point where she paid the two officers a bribe. “This matter was brought to my attention and I  reached out to the resident to support her and ensure  action was taken. Arrangements were made for the officers who were on duty on Monday to report to Garsfontein police station where they were questioned and eventually arrested,” said Theunissen. The city had initiated  the necessary internal processes for the suspension of the two officers pending the investigation. “I would like to make it unequivocally clear that the City of Tshwane has a zero-tolerance approach to bribery, corruption or any illegal activities by those within our ranks. Incidents of corruption will be dealt with decisively without fear as we root out those who abuse their power and fail to uphold their oaths of office.” Theunissen said he  would ensure  the matter  was properly investigated and dealt with. “We are  working on a programme to curb lawlessness, corruption and bribery within our law enforcement units which will ensure that we immediately move against those who extort residents.” TimesLIVE
