An alcohol-fuelled altercation between a KwaDwesi couple left a 40-year-old woman dead and her boyfriend behind bars on Tuesday. Police spokesperson Captain Sandra Janse van Rensburg said the 39-year-old  murder suspect had handed himself over to police after the death of his girlfriend. “It is alleged that on Monday between 10pm and 11pm, Nompumelelo Mabhoza, 40, and her boyfriend were drinking together and later engaged in an argument. “Mabhoza was assaulted with a plank on her head.” She said that after the brawl, they had both gone to bed. “The suspect left the house on Tuesday morning and when he  returned at about 6.30pm, he noticed that she was still in bed but was not responding.” The suspect, accompanied by his brother, reported the incident at the  KwaDwesi police station. “Police went to the house in Mdwara Street, Govan Mbeki, where they found her dead, with visible injuries to her face.” The man was arrested on a charge of murder and will appear in the New Brighton Magistrate’s Court on Thursday.
