The justice, crime prevention and security cluster will give  a progress report on the  July 2021 violent unrest and looting on Friday. SAPS spokesperson Siphiwe Dlamini said the media briefing  would, among other things,  report on progress made  in implementing  the recommendations by the expert panel  and on criminal cases and the economic impact on people's livelihoods. SA experienced violent civil unrest, mainly in parts of  KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng, between July 8 and 17 2021. The unrest was characterised by social media mobilisation leading to looting, destruction of property and  disruption of economic activity. President Cyril Ramaphosa in August announced the appointment of an expert panel to review SA’s response to the unrest, including the country's preparedness and shortcomings in responding. TimesLIVE
