As if stage 6 load-shedding wasn’t bad enough, South Africans will experience  more suffering this week when the price of fuel goes up by more than R2 a litre. Fuel prices will reach record levels on Wednesday when  they go up by R2.37/l for 93 octane petrol,  R2.57/l for 95 octane, R2.30/l for low sulphur 50ppm diesel, R2.31/l  for 500ppm and R2.21/l for illuminating paraffin. Inland motorists will pay  R26.30/1 for 93 octane petrol and  R26.74 for 95 octane. From Wednesday 500ppm diesel will cost R25.40 inland and 50ppm diesel R25.53. The prices are nearly R10/l more than a year ago. The increases come on the back of the ongoing war in Ukraine and increased international fuel prices. Looking ahead, motorists can expect no mercy, as  the temporary reduction in the fuel levy is expected to expire next month and the international fuel price continues its rise. Shocked South Africans took to social media to share their frustration about the new fuel prices, with many calling for a nationwide protest over rising costs.
