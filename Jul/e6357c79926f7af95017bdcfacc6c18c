Some level of normality has been restored in Mbombela, Mpumalanga, after  disruptive protests in the past two days that saw the town  at a standstill — but taxi drivers  warned  this  was not the end of their protests. Police spokesperson Brig Selvy Mohlala told TimesLIVE everything is running as usual, but police  are on the ground to monitor the situation. “The CBD and all major roads leading in and out of Mbombela are accessible. Things look  quiet at the moment but we remain on the ground, monitoring the situation for  possible disruptions,” Mohlala said. At  Kruger National Park, the situation is also said to be calm. SANParks spokesperson Ike Phaahla said on Friday things were running as normal and they had not received  reports of disruptions or blockages. He said the  park was accessible and they were closely monitoring the situation. On Wednesday, protesters blocked roads near the park. Chairperson of  a regional taxi drivers' association, Themba Masuku, told TimesLIVE  they staged protests due to  rising fuel costs, which he said were no longer affordable. This week fuel prices jumped by: “We are working for fuel. We can no longer  manage to meet the targets set by  owners for how much we  should bring in daily,” Masuku said. He said they  put their protests on hold on Friday because they wanted to allow grieving families to be able to bury their loved ones at the weekend. “We don’t have any tangible response from the government so we’ll wait and see. If we don’t have any response by Monday, on Tuesday we are closing the roads again.” Muntu Gama, of the SA National Taxi Council (Santaco) in Mpumalanga, distanced the association from the Mbombela shutdown. “We had nothing to do with the shutdown on Wednesday because Santaco is engaging nationally with stakeholders on the issue of rising fuel costs. The shutdown was organised by taxi drivers. They also took us by surprise,” Gama said. TimesLIVE
