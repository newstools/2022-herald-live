When 13-year-old Jerobiojin van Wyk went missing on February 2, his mother tried to get assistance from Klawer police. Eventually, five days later, her pleas were taken seriously when human remains were found on the property of train driver Daniel Smit. Listen to the story here: When Smit’s attorney told media  her client said he was responsible for multiple murders and had connections with a cult, South Africans' interest was aroused.
