The  High Court in Johannesburg will  hear testimony from African Literature scholar professor Elizabeth Gunner in the case between the EFF and lobby group AfriForum. EFF leader Julius Malema stood by his belief that the singing of the struggle song "Dubula ibhunu" which translates to "Kill the Boer" played no role in farm attacks. The lobby group argues that the singing of the song incites violence and contributes to an  increase in farm attacks. On his second day of giving evidence, Malema said singing the song did not have the same effect  as giving a command.
