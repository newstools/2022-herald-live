SA must remove the negative PCR test requirement for fully vaccinated incoming travellers to stimulate  tourism. That’s the call the Tourism Business Council of SA (TBCSA) made to the government on Wednesday. The council said several countries with a strong tourism value  have already done so. “Further delays in following suit  are detrimental to the country positioning itself as travel-ready and attractive,” said TBCSA head Tshifhiwa Tshivhengwa. “We have a  small window of opportunity as tourism destinations around the world, such as  Australia, reopen and others, such as the UK, remove the negative PCR testing requirement for  inbound travellers.” The  council reiterated its call days after the Botswana government announced that fully vaccinated travellers would no longer be required to  provide a negative PCR test to enter the country. “Beyond the requirement being difficult and expensive for many international visitors, the World Health Organisation has stated  that international travellers should not be considered a priority group for PCR testing and  those who have been fully vaccinated should be exempt from heightened travel restrictions. “Our tourism industry needs to get back to business and our people need to get back to work. Travellers are ready to visit and  contribute to our industry’s growth. However, the PCR test requirement is the biggest inhibitor.” TimesLIVE
