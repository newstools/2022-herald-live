The teenager accused of killing a King Edward VII pupil outside a Sandton club will be sleeping in jail another night after his lawyer failed to show up in court on time. Dante Kade Liang, 18, was meant to apply for bail on Monday at the Alexandra magistrate's court after allegedly stabbing 17-year-old Hlompho  Mbetse to death on February 6. Mbetse and Liang allegedly had an altercation the week before the murder. Magistrate Reiner Boshoff  postponed the application to Tuesday. “I have a much older case on my roll today [Monday]. My court starts at 9am. Your [Liang's] lawyers want to hold this court hostage,” he said. Boshoff  requested that media withhold pictures of the accused until he is able to review an application with Liang’s lawyers present in court. A memorial service for Mbetse was held at the school on Friday. He was buried on Sunday. SowetanLIVE
