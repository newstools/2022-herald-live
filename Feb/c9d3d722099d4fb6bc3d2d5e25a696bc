She said they had been detained on charges relating to the Criminal Matters Amendment Act: damage to essential infrastructure. Spades, pickaxes, pangas, knives, cables, scissors and backpacks had been confiscated, she said. The suspects, aged between 24 and 28, are expected to appear in court soon. HeraldLIVE
