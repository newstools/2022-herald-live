Three men are expected to appear in the Port Alfred magistrate’s court on Thursday  after police arrested them  on Tuesday morning while they were  transporting 13 goats,  allegedly stolen from a farm in Peddie. Police spokesperson Warrant Officer Majola Nkohli said  that at about 2.30am Port Alfred K9  members  had been patrolling the R72 and spotted a suspicious white Ford bakkie. Nkohli said the movement of animals at the back of the  bakkie had attracted the attention of the police. “The police  pulled the  bakkie off the road at the corner of Miles and Southwell streets.  There were three occupants in the bakkie and  13 goats at the back. “The police searched  the vehicle and  seized a shotgun and  ammunition. “The occupants could not give a satisfactory account about the goats. “Preliminary investigation revealed that the goats, worth  about R48 000, had been stolen from a farm in Peddie,” Nkohli said. The goats and the bakkie were seized and Nkohli said an application for the vehicle to be forfeited to the state would be made. The three suspects are charged with  stock theft and possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition. HeraldLIVE
