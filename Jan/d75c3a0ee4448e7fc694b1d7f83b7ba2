YouTuber Logan Paul may have squared up to the likes of Floyd Mayweather in the boxing ring, but he was no match for  mischievous baboons  in the Mother City. Paul had followers around the world in stitches on Sunday when he shared a clip of him being “bullied” by  baboons while on a trip to Cape Town. The video shows Paul jumping  and screaming: “Not the camera! What do I do?!”, as the shot shows two baboons in front of him. One baboon is on a car and the second is rummaging through what Paul’s bag. The baboon on the car roof then lunges at the star, who runs away. “WTF just happened?” he captioned the clip. While many laughed at “tough guy” Paul getting “owned” by the baboons, others shared advice on how to handle a confrontation with the animals.
