Payment of the R350 social relief of distress (SRD) grants will  take place on Tuesday this week and continue next week for the month of February. The SA Post Office (Sapo) announced  the first week of the month will be reserved for the payment of old age, child and disability grants. Beneficiaries can collect their payments at post offices by using the ID number system which determines payment dates according to the last three digits of beneficiaries’ identity numbers. Last week the SA Social Security Agency (Sassa)  said those who requested that their rejected  SRD grant applications be reconsidered should expect a delay in the process. “Clients who applied for reconsideration are advised of the delay in addressing the reconsideration requests. Sassa is  working to resolve this,” it said. Sassa announced the reconsideration option late last year after many social media users flooded its pages to complain that their applications were cancelled without  explanation. The agency  urged those who have married or changed their surnames since applying for the grant to inform Sassa. This is to avoid complications with applications that could result in recipients not being paid. “Clients who get married or change their surname at the department of home affairs are urged to update Sassa of the change. “Sassa validates the client’s information with the department of home affairs monthly. If details do not match, the application for the period may be declined,” said Sassa. The dates below are applicable to the  Sapo payout system. Beneficiaries can obtain their grants as soon as they receive confirmation of payment from Sassa.
