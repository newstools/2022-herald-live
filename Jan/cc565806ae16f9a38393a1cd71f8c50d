No stranger to the mic, Umhlobo Wenene presenter Putco Mafani is our guest on Behind The Herald Headlines with Daron Mann this week.The popular broadcast personality was suspended — or “unscheduled” — after a video of him dancing on a table, apparently inside SABC studios, surfaced. Mafani talks about doing the #UmlandoChallenge, a new craze popular on Tik Tok, where participants shake their hips from side to side and up and down.
