Arnold Terblanche, the Gqeberha businessman accused of orchestrating his estranged wife's murder, has been denied bail in the city's magistrate's court. Terblanche is accused of ordering a hit on Vicki, the mother of his minor son, in October last year. Vikki was drugged and then suffocated before being buried in a shallow grave in Greenbushes in October. Her body was uncovered by police days later. The Terblanches were going through an acrimonious divorce, together with a heated custody battle over their minor son. Though Terblanche and Leach have denied all involvement in the murder, only Terblanche has proceeded with his application for bail. A third accused, Leach’s friend, Dylan Cullis, is expected to testify for the state. All three spent the festive season behind bars. HeraldLIVE
