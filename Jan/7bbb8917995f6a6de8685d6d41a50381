Five stars is usually the most a luxury hotel can get, but one in Cape Town gives its canine guests such a pampering that its owners say it deserves six. The city’s Superwoof  Dog Hotel provides the pooches of well-to-do  residents with the kind of treatment many humans in poverty-stricken SA  can only dream  about. “We’ve  tried to make sure  we offer a six-star service,” said Watson Mpala, a dog handler at Superwoof. “With 24-hour supervision and the luxuries of our splash pool and giant lounges, we  want to provide a luxury experience for the doggos,” Mpala told Reuters TV. The experience includes long walks in the  countryside of the nearby Franschhoek valley in the  Western Cape wine-growing region. Nearly three decades since the end of white minority rule, SA remains one of the world’s most unequal countries, with half the country living below the official poverty line — a group that includes  residents  at the homeless shelter opposite the  dog care centre. Among the hotel’s highlights is dog champagne, “champaws”, which is water with herbs in a champagne bottle. It was unclear if the furry guests  appreciated that  status symbol, whether their  ears were attuned to the fine jazz,  and what they made of the Sky Deck’s touted view of Table Mountain — dogs have  poor long-distance vision when it comes to stationary objects. One guest, a Vizsla, seemed more  keen to chill out than sample the delights. He nodded off on a soft couch. Reuters
