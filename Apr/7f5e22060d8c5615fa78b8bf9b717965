Former public protector Thuli Madonsela has weighed in on the sentence  handed to Walter Sisulu University student Sibongile Mani, saying it is a curious conviction and sentence. The education honours degree student was this week sentenced to five years in jail for the theft of more than R800,000 in National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) funds. On Wednesday the National Prosecuting Authority  confirmed her R1,500 bail had been extended after her lawyer said she would appeal  her conviction and sentence. “Hers is a curious conviction and sentence. Ordinarily, when a person is erroneously paid more than the contracted amount, the owner is entitled to a delictual claim under unjustified enrichment,” claimed Madonsela. “I know of no case where the erroneous recipient was considered a criminal and jailed.” Madonsela said she was curious  whether theft was the right conviction, given the funds abused constituted an erroneous overpayment to Mani. “I have suggested  our legal  curiosity takes us to explore the principles of unjustified enrichment or unjust enrichment. I realise, based on Daniel  Visser’s voluminous book titled Unjustified Enrichment, which I used for Nkandla [case], unjustified enrichment may be a stretch,” she said. Madonsela questioned if the court’s justice paradigm was within the ubuntu spirit of S v Makwanyane. “We must ask the question whether  the court’s justice paradigm, in this case, remains within the ubuntu spirit of Makwanyane,” she said. On Thursday the NFSAS denied reports  it had a hand in the conviction and sentencing of Mani. “We wish to confirm  NSFAS did not institute any criminal proceedings against the student as there was no basis for it to do so. “NSFAS was approached to furnish the department of correctional services with a victim impact assessment report, which was  submitted on March 14,” it said. The NFSAS reiterated  it did not suffer any financial loss due to the erroneous payment to Mani.
