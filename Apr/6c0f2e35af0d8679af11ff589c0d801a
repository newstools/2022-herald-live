NPA spokesperson Mashudu Malabi-Dzhangi said the case has been postponed to June 24. “It is alleged that the suspects fraudulently obtained a tender for Talana shacks, by using misrepresentations and forged credentials of land surveyors and architects, while they were not permitted by the professionals to use their documents,” she said.
