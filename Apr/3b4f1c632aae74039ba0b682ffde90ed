Various Christian denominations gathered at the Nangoza Jebe Hall in New Brighton on Saturday to pray for rain  this coming season. The interdenominational service also  highlighted the community’s role in saving water. Event organiser Noxolo Speelman said it was important for communities to know  the situation in the metro was  critical. “It is important for people to know that even if we do get rain, people have to be more active in saving water,”  Speelman said. “We came together as Christians not only to pray but to drive this awareness campaign. “Water has always been available since before we were created. “We believe as Christians that when the Lord withholds rain it may be because of our sins and [we must] repent. “That is why it was important for us to gather,” he said. Deputy mayor Buyelwa Mafaya, who was the keynote speaker at the event, called for more unity between politicians and church leaders. “We urge all church leaders, community leaders, traditional leaders, politicians and civil society to assist in stopping this economic destruction. “We also as government need to act and respond with maximum caution during this time of panic and uncertainty,” Mafaya said.
