The City of Tshwane has announced that rhino Pippa has given birth to a second calf at Rietvlei Nature Reserve. According to the city, the  calf was first spotted with its mother early on Friday morning and  is estimated to be about two days old. MMC  for environment and agriculture management Katlego Mathebe said the calf’s gender cannot  be determined yet because conservation officials will not disturb the two, giving them sufficient time to bond. “The calf will only be named once its gender has been determined. Pippa was born at Rietvlei Nature Reserve eight years ago and this is her second calf,” she said. Mathebe said while the city is excited by this new addition to the  reserve, they are concerned  the  cold snap may be a threat to the calf’s survival. “We urge the public not to harass Pippa and the newborn, and to give the new mother space to protect her young.” Mathebe said conservation officials have  warned that Pippa  displayed  aggressive behaviour when the calf was discovered on Friday morning.  She  urged the public to stay as far away from the two as possible. “Established in 1929, Rietvlei Nature Reserve is one of the largest urban nature reserves in SA and has an abundance of wildlife  on city dwellers’ doorsteps. “The reserve  boasts three of the Big Seven species of SA (buffalo, rhino and cheetah). We are also working towards re-establishing our lion population.” TimesLIVE
