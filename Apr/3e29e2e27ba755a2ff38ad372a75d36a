More than 100 early childhood development centres (ECDs) in the Western Cape risk losing their funding after they failed to send banking details to the provincial education department. Nationally, responsibility for ECDs passed from social development to basic education on April 1. The Western Cape said on Thursday it wrote to 819 ECDs  in January asking them to confirm their banking details so subsidies could be paid. About 715 centres “returned the required documentation and have been successfully migrated to the education department”, the department said. “The documentation for 104 ECDs  remains outstanding despite ongoing calls for them to submit the paperwork. The  consequence is that without the required documentation we are unable to make payment to them. “We  appeal  to these centres to  contact us as soon as possible so ... they receive their subsidy timeously.” The  department said the 104 ECDs  would be visited next week. They could also call 021-483-2519 for  help or e-mail Kim.Hendricks@westerncape.gov.za. “A lot of work has gone into the transfer of this function and we will continue to work hard to ensure it is a success. We cannot, however, process payments that are not in line with  financial regulations and the receipt of these basic documents will ensure the uninterrupted financing of these centres.” TimesLIVE
