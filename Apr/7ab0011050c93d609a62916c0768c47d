Due to a significant shortfall in generation capacity over the Easter weekend, Eskom has implemented stage 4 load-shedding which will end on Friday morning at the latest. “This is a really disappointing performance,” said Eskom CEO Andre de Ruyter during a media press briefing Tuesday. Ruyters explained that over the weekend, weather implications along with Eskom's inability to “bring back units as planned”  led to the inevitable decision to implement load-shedding once again. Eskom hopes to shed around 4,000MW  which it believes will allow it to “safely navigate through the current demand on the system in order to prevent a total collapse of the system”. TimesLIVE
