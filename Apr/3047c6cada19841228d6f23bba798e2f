New sub-lineages of the Omicron variant of  Covid-19 have  been discovered by researchers in SA and Botswana. Researchers say  little is known about the sub-lineages  named BA.4 and BA.5, but people should not panic because the number of hospitalisations, infections and deaths have not spiked. Dr Nicksy Gumede-Moeletsi, a  virologist with the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) regional office for Africa,  said  the researchers   still have much to do to understand the threat  the new sub-lineages may pose. LISTEN HERE: Here is what she had to say: The WHO announced that the sub-lineages have been identified in four people in Botswana and 23 in SA. Outside Africa,  sub-lineages have been confirmed in Belgium, Denmark, Germany and the UK. Gumede-Moeletsi asked the international community to not undertake punitive measures against the African countries that brought attention to the new sub-lineages. She said doing so not only unjustly stunts their economies, but also discourages adequate genomic surveillance. Previously discovered omicron sub-lineage BA.2 was  well known for its rapid infection rate which caused  global concern.
