A man who allegedly attempted to kill his girlfriend's  eight-year-old child by slitting her throat has abandoned  his bid for bail. The 31-year-old appeared  in the Mamelodi magistrate’s court on Thursday  on a charge of attempted murder. NPA spokesperson Lumka Mahanjana said the man and the mother of the  girl are in a relationship. “It is alleged that on April 24 the couple went to a funeral where an argument broke out between them. The  next day, while the mother of the  girl  went to a nearby car wash, the accused went to the house where she  lived to try  to work things out.” Mahanjana said when the man arrived he found the  girl with her grandmother and  he allegedly  found a butcher's knife  in the kitchen. “The mother of the victim heard the screams of her mother and  rushed home,  took her injured child and rushed her to a nearby hospital. “The child survived  and is now back from the hospital and recovering at home.” A petition containing 98 signatures of community members demanding that the accused not be released on bail was submitted in court. The matter has been postponed to May 30 for further investigation. TimesLIVE
