Kwazakhele police made it a quick checkout for a 34-year-old man after he was arrested for the possession of  groceries and other stolen items worth more than R10,000  on Tuesday night. Police spokesperson Captain Gerda Swart said the police had received  information about a hijacked vehicle  seen offloading items. The vehicle, which had been hijacked in Humewood on Tuesday afternoon, was traced to an address  in Soweto-on-Sea  at about 7.30pm. However, the vehicle was gone when the police arrived. “[The officers] noticed several containers of bottled water lying on the ground. “Further investigations led the team to the groceries, worth more than R10,000,  packed on the floor inside the house,” Swart said. She said the homeowner failed to provide a reasonable explanation and proof of where the groceries were  bought and was  arrested for possession of stolen goods. The suspect was also allegedly found in possession of three live rounds of ammunition and is facing a second charge of unlawful possession of ammunition. The hijacked vehicle was later found abandoned in Joe Slovo. HeraldLIVE
