Grocery chain store Spar is trending on Twitter after a poster asking customers not to shop in their pyjamas circulated on the platform. The poster, which has Spar branding, reads: “Dear customers. No pyjamas or nightgowns allowed.” It  is unclear where and when the poster was placed. Attempts to get comment from Spar  were unsuccessful at the time of publishing this article. Any comment will be included once received. After a similar “announcement” went viral in 2016, the group told EWN its  policy did not dictate what customers can and can’t wear. “In terms of group policy, you can wear whatever you want when shopping in a Spar store. We will never dictate what you can and cannot wear, within the bounds of decency . And  each  of our stores would be  different. If you were a retailer on the Durban beachfront it would be acceptable for someone to come in a swimming costume and slops.” The latest poster has received mixed reactions from users who debated shopping in  one’s nightie. Some  said it is inappropriate and unhygienic to visit a  shop in  one’s sleepwear, while others said  shops  had no authority to dictate how people dress.
