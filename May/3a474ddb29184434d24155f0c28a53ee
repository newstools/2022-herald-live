Gqeberha Flying Squad members and Algoa Park police have arrested a suspect for the theft of  electronic devices from a motor vehicle. At about noon on Tuesday, a motorist   reported  that his  Nissan NP200 LDV had been broken into outside a  retail shop in Algoa Park and two electronic devices had been stolen out of the vehicle. Police  spotted the suspected getaway vehicle, a silver Renault,  in Green Street, North End. According to police spokesperson Captain Sandra Janse van Rensburg,  the suspect  attempted to flee into the harbour, but was unable to enter the port due to the access control. “The Flying Squad members managed to block off the vehicle and arrested a 24-year-old suspect. “The  electronic devices were also recovered,” Janse van Rensburg said. The man  was detained on a charge of theft out of a motor vehicle and is expected to appear in the New Brighton Magistrate’s Court  this week. The suspect’s vehicle was also impounded. HeraldLIVE
