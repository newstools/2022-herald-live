At the time it was alleged  three gunmen  opened fire on the victims,” said provincial police spokesperson Brig Novela Potelwa. “In relation to the arrest of the 25-year-old suspect, the investigation took the integrated teams comprising detectives, intelligence officials and Eastern Cape police to Cala in the Eastern Cape where the suspect was apprehended.” The second suspect was arrested in Khayelitsha on Tuesday. An unlicensed firearm suspected to be the murder weapon for the five murders was allegedly found in his possession.
